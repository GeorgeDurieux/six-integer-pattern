# Six Integer Pattern

The Six Integer Pattern project generates unique patterns of six integers from a user-defined set of numbers, adhering to specific rules and constraints.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Accepts between 7 and 49 unique integers (1â€“49).
- **Pattern Generation**: Produces all valid combinations of six integers.
- **Constraint Filtering**: Removes patterns that:
  - Exceed 4 even or odd numbers.
  - Include more than 2 consecutive integers.
  - Have too many integers with the same last digit or from the same decade.

## Example
